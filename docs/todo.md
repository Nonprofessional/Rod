# Rod -- Todo

Open work only. An item leaves this file the moment it ships -- its record
is the commit history, and the design it followed lives in
[architecture.md](architecture.md); the designed-but-deferred items (the
redirector control plane, Sec 8; sealing, Sec 9) stay where they are
designed. Nothing here is an archive of the done.

Each item names the architecture section it serves and carries a one-line
acceptance criterion (_AC:_), so "done" stays testable. Follow the
[repository conventions](../AGENTS.md).

Lean is the standing default: an addition must say what an engagement
cannot do without it; refactors, deletions, and answering with docs
instead of code are first-class items here, equal to features. New work
starts from a gap an actual engagement surfaces.

Active is advisory order, not a queue: depth before breadth -- making the
platform's standing promises real (the compiled capability surface, the
advertised reach) ahead of widening the story, the small bounded items
behind those -- and the right item to take is still the one an engagement
actually needs. On hold is parking, not rejection: each item there names
the fact or decision that reopens it, and a cleared condition prompts the
move back into Active -- it does not make the move on its own.

## Active

(Nothing queued. The redirector control plane shipped 2026-10-12 as Sec 8's
enrolled fleet -- including the DNS front's datagram relay and the typed
dial's dissolution, per [operations/redirectors.md](operations/redirectors.md)
Sec 0. The MCP write tools shipped behind their gate the same day, per
[operations/mcp.md](operations/mcp.md).)

## On hold

- **iOS shell for the Rust implant** (serves architecture.md Sec 12.2).
  Parked on a macOS build host: the Apple link needs Xcode's SDK, which
  the Linux host cannot carry. Shape: the same library-plus-shell pattern
  as the Android item against aarch64-apple-ios; delivery is inherently
  sideloading territory (a signed carrier app or a jailbroken device), an
  operational constraint the runbook documents rather than something the
  build can remove.
  _AC:_ cross-compiling from a macOS host produces a static library a
  carrier app links, and the enrollment leg runs.
