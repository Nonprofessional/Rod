/// through the campaign's relay. The webhook engine's shape -- a reconciler,
/// not a queue: it re-reads the store every tick, holds no state of its

/// Delivery is single-attempt with no retry: a failure is terminal on the

/// trail stays the record, exactly as webhook delivery keeps it. Builds
