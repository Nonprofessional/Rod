/// One bound C2 ingress the teamserver terminates (architecture.md Sec 8).

/// create binds for one engagement (enrollment through it checks the
/// presented token against <see cref="EngagementId"/>), and the startup-
/// configuration tier -- the operator front and any deliberately shared
/// ingress -- which leaves <see cref="EngagementId"/> null and carries no
/// implant ingress at all: enrollment and the payload fetch are refused on
/// it outright. A redirector fronts a listener;
/// a burned redirector is replaced without touching the backend.
///
/// The listener decouples the address Kestrel opens (<see cref="BindAddress"/>) from
/// the address implants are told to dial (<see cref="PublicEndpoint"/>). The bind
/// address is operational plumbing (which interface and port the process opens);
/// the public endpoint is the redirector or host-header the implant carries in its
/// profile. They are independent so the public endpoint can move -- a redirected
/// domain, a different host -- without reconfiguring or restarting the listener:
/// <see cref="Repoint"/> swaps the public endpoint at runtime (architecture.md
/// Sec 7/8), leaving the bound socket untouched. Repointing away from an
/// endpoint severs it -- the registry's public-endpoint lookup no longer resolves
/// it -- so a burned redirector is retired by pointing its listener elsewhere.
