/// yields a per-subscriber stream. State is process-local and lost on restart;
/// the port keeps callers agnostic to that.
///
/// Live state is best-effort: the audit trail (architecture.md Sec 11) is the
/// durable, attributed record, and this bus is the transient projection
/// operators read while connected. A slow subscriber never blocks a publisher:
/// each subscriber's channel is bounded, and a full channel drops the oldest
/// undelivered event rather than stalling the producer or the other peers. The
/// dropped subscriber still sees the latest state on its next list read.
///
/// Engagement isolation is by construction: a subscriber receives only its own
/// engagement's events, because publish and subscribe are both keyed on the
/// engagement id (architecture.md Sec 3).
