/// as live channels (architecture.md Sec 10.3, the streaming task shape): the
/// task's channel carries the tunnel's bytes both ways, so the traffic rides
/// the beacon stream the signed TaskRequest opened and is attributed to the
/// task end to end.

/// Concrete behavior for these verbs is not part of this repository -- it lives
/// in the implant and is captured as task output over the beacon stream
/// (architecture.md Sec 10.3). Here they are descriptors only: enough for the
/// registry to know the verb exists and for the task-issuance gate to resolve
/// it. The tunnel verbs carry a <c>touches-network</c> OPSEC attribute
/// (architecture.md Sec 7) since each opens a network connection from the
/// target.
